It was seen as\\none of the major factors leading the First Interstate\\nwithdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.\\n    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer\\nthan expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.\\n    \\\"The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,\\\"\\nsaid Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial\\nCommunications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with\\nthe offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.\\n    \\\"I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could,\\\" said\\nLawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and\\nSmith.\\n    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they\\nhave to show the market an improved financial outlook.\\n    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of\\nequities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible\\npreferred stock would encompass at least part of it.\\n    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a\\nlower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock\\nholders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.\\n    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian\\ndebt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry\\nthrough the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to\\nease over the coming weeks.\\n    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion\\ndlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the\\ninterest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln\\ndlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph\\nArsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.\\n    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show\\nup in the current quarter.\\n    With other major banks standing to lose even more than\\nBankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts\\nsaid they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way\\nMexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.\\n Reuter\\n\u0003</body></text>\\n</REUTERS>"

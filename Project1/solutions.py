"""
Write your reusable code here.
Main method stubs corresponding to each block is initialized here. Do not modify the signature of the functions already
created for you. But if necessary you can implement any number of additional functions that you might think useful to you
within this script.

Delete "Delete this block first" code stub after writing solutions to each function.

Write you code within the "WRITE YOUR CODE HERE vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv" code stub. Variable created within this stub are just
for example to show what is expected to be returned. You CAN modify them according to your preference.

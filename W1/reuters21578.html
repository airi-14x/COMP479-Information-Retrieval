<title>Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Test Collection</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 align="left">Test Collections</h2>
<h1 align="center">Reuters-21578 </h1>
<p>Currently the most widely used test collection for text categorization
research, though likely to be superceded over the next few years by <a href="http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/rcv1">RCV1</a>.&nbsp;
The data was originally collected and labeled by Carnegie Group, Inc. and
Reuters, Ltd. in the course of developing the CONSTRUE text categorization
system.&nbsp; Further details, including discussion of previous versions of the
collection (e.g. Reuters-22173), are available in the <a href="http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/readme.txt">README
file</a>. </p>
<p>The collection is available here as a <a href="http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/reuters21578.tar.gz">gzipped
tar archive</a> (8.2 MB; 28.0 MB uncompressed).&nbsp; The <a href="http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/">UCI
KDD archive</a> also has an entry for the <a href="http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/reuters21578/reuters21578.html">collection</a>,
including a copy.&nbsp; The version at UCI is identical, and I encourage you to
get the UCI copy if available to save bandwidth at this site.&nbsp; Previous locations of the collection (now no longer
active) were http://www.research.att.com/~lewis/reuters21578.html and
ftp:://canberra.cs.umass.edu/pub/reuters. </p>
<p>Various researchers have prepared data files useful for work with
Reuters-21578.&nbsp; Contact me if you would like me to host such resources here;
I am happy to if their disk space
requirements are modest.&nbsp; Currently the only such resource available here
is a <a href="http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/feldman-cia-worldfactbook-data.txt">PROLOG
fact base about countries</a> contributed by Ronen Feldman.</p>
